# TF2 Blacklist Builder

This application allows you to easily build a server blacklist based on any combination of partial name matches, partial map matches, tags, or public cvars. Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/TF2-Blacklist-Builder/releases) section to get started.

At the moment, only Windows builds are available.
